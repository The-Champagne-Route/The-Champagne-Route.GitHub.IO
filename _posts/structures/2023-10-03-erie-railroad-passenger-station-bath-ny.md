The Erie Passenger Station was used by the Bath and Hammondsport until 1918, when passenger service ended in tandem with the steamboat service on Keuka Lake. The Erie Railroad maintained passenger service until 1954. And the station was torn down soon after.

Just visible photo left is the water tank, a semaphore signal, the water tap for topping off the locomotives. It appears as though there is some activity on the Bath & Hammondsport main track, perhaps it has just arrived from, or is gettting ready to depart for Hammandsport.
