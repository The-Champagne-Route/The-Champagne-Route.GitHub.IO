This photo is looking South through the covered wharf towards the curved freight house. We can see Keuka Lake to our left and a ramp up to the freight house. Crates of wine have presumably been shipped from the many wineries around the lake to Hammondsport and sit along each side of the track awaiting a boxcar to Bath and interchange with the Erie Railroad. In the background, just to the right of the curved freight house we can see a steamer, a few boxcars, and the O. Brundage hardware store.
