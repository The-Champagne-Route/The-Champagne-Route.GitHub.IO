#### Captain Wood
Hammondsport Herald, Wed., April 21, 1875
 : Capt. Wood has been in Smithville, N.Y., the past week, superintending the removal of the iron for our rail road. The work is being pushed rapidly forward by T.E. Rollins, of Corning, who has charge of the work. They were delayed two days last week by the fall of a foot of snow, and the washing away of a bank by the high water. The rails will be sent to Bath as fast as they can get car loads made up.

Steuben Courier, Bath, N.Y., Wed., April 28, 1875

Steuben Courier, Wed., May 19, 1875

The road is nine miles and a half long to the Erie depot, and the heaviest grade is 132 feet to the mile. This grade continues for about six thousand feet.
 : The three feet gauge cars will be an entire novelty in this region. The passenger coaches are about thirty-two feet long, and six and one half feet wide, and will accommodate thirty-two persons. The seats are arranged in the same manner as those in broad gauge cars, but on one side they will accommodate two persons, while those on the other side will accommodate but one. There will be three trains each way daily, one in the morning, one at noon, and one at night. They will connect with the Erie trains at Bath, and with the steamboats at Hammondsport. The intermediate stations will be County House, Cold Spring, and Pleasant Valley.
