The Station at Hammondsport was built with an attached freight depot. When the Bath and Hammondsport began operations it was a three-foot narrow-gauge railroad. The line widened to standard gauge (4' 8-1/2") in 1889. The track plan at Hammondsport had changed several times since the railroad began operations.
