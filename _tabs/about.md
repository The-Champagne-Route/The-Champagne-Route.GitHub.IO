The Bath and Hammondsport Railroad was chartered by the State of New York in 1872 and began operations on July 5, 1875 as a three-foot narrow-gauge railroad. Running just over nine miles from it namesake towns of Bath, NY northward through the fertile valley to Hammondsport, NY at the head of Kueka Lake.

Passengers would come to Bath via the Erie or Delaware Lackawana and Western Railroads and ride the B&H to Hammondsport where they could board steamboats to many a resort hotel along the lake.

Wine and champagne and grapes became major commodites for the region as production increased. Via interchange with the Erie Railroad, the B&H enabled goods from Hammondsport and Keuka Lake the fastest path to New York City and points West. 

During the late 1890s and early 1900s the Erie Railroad consolidated the competing steamship lines and began aquiring stock in the B&H. In 1903 the Erie Railroad took control of the B&H. Passenger service remained active until 1917 when the steamboat service on Keuka lake was discontinued.

The Depression took its toll on the Erie and after a washout of some trackage during a flood during 1935, the Erie wanted out. If not for several local businessmen coming together to buy and restart operations the story would end here.

As it was the B&H restarted its operation in 1936, free of Erie control.
